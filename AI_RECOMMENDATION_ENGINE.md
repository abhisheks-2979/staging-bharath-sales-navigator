## Algorithm & Logic

### Beat Visit Priority Scoring
```
Priority Score = 
  (Days Since Last Visit × 0.4) +
  (Retailer Count × 0.2) +
  (Total Potential Value × 0.3) +
  (Historical Order Value × 0.1)

Normalized to 0-1 scale
```

### Retailer Priority Scoring
```
Priority Score =
  (Days Since Last Visit × 0.35) +
  (Potential Level × 0.25) +
  (Average Order Value × 0.20) +
  (Growth Rate × 0.15) +
  (Order Frequency × 0.05)

Normalized to 0-1 scale
```

### AI Model Used

## User Feedback System

Users can provide feedback on recommendations:

Feedback is stored and can be used to:
- Improve future recommendations
- Track AI effectiveness
- Identify patterns in user preferences

## Data Privacy & Security

- All recommendations are user-specific (RLS enabled)
- Users can only see their own recommendations
- Recommendations expire after 24 hours
- Feedback is anonymous to the AI system
- No sensitive retailer data leaves your system

## Performance Optimization

- Recommendations are cached for 24 hours
- Parallel data fetching for speed
- Indexed database queries
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions

## Best Practices for Users

1. **Generate recommendations regularly** - Daily or weekly
2. **Provide feedback** - Helps improve accuracy over time
3. **Combine with your expertise** - AI assists, you decide
4. **Review reasoning** - Understand why suggestions are made
5. **Track implementation** - Mark what you actually use

## Troubleshooting

### No recommendations showing?
- Ensure you have created beats and retailers
- Check that you have historical order data
- Verify beat is planned for the selected date

### AI generation fails?
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Lovable AI credits are available
- Check edge function logs in Supabase dashboard

### Low confidence scores?
